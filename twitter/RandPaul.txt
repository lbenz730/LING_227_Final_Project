"Or will the #ClintonCash secure the Saudis more favors and a blind eye to their terror financing and human rights abuses?"
"I can't be silent about Obama's Saudi arms deals. What will Hillary Clinton do? Will she stand up &amp; oppose selling weapons to Saudi Arabia?"
"Stop fueling a Middle East arms race and worsening an already horrific refugee crisis in Yemen."
"Stop ignoring the cost of war and the innocent lives lost."
"Stop arming countries who participate in financing terrorists and Islamic extremists around the world."
"I'm standing up today to say no more. Stop. Stop arming nations that abuse their citizens and human rights."
"Now Obama wants another $1.15 billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia because apparently his $100 billion in arms deals weren't enough."
"Hillary Clinton looked the other way to the Saudi war on women and their terror financing because they bought her off."
"Keep in mind this is also a country that recently bombed a hospital and school and consistently oppresses and violates the rights of women."
"In fact, Hillary Clinton's foundation has even taken $10-25 million from the Saudi regime and millions from a Saudi prince."
"This was known to both president Obama and Hillary Clinton. But they continue to treat Saudi Arabia as a trusted ally."
"Citizens and officials of one of our so called allies, Saudi Arabia, were involved in the financing of terror including 9/11."
"I fought hard to have the 28 pages of the 9/11 report made public so Americans could know the truth."
"By continuing to arm Saudi Arabia the Obama Administration ignores horrific human rights abuses and duplicitous actions by the Saudi regime."
"A vote on selling arms to Saudi Arabia is a proxy vote on whether or not there should be unending war in the Middle East."
